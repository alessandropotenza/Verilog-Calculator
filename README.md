# Calculator Build using Verilog
Created as part of a group design project for ECE 2220: Digital Logic Systems.

## Description
The Verilog code found in "Calculator.v" used to configure the programmable logic circuitry in the Intel SoC FPGA of the Terasic DE10-Standard Development Kit. The program implements a sophisticated calculator that can perform a series of mathematical operations and also binary and boolean logic functions. It also configures an intuitive interface for interacting with the program by leveraging the board's pushbuttons, switches, and 7-segment displays.

## Features
#### Mathematical Operations
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Exponentials
- Factorials
- Permutations
- Combinations

#### Binary & Boolean Logic Functions
- n-bit AND and OR functions (max n=6)
- Decimal-Binary conversions
